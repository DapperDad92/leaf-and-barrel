# Bottles Screen Implementation

## What's Been Added

### 1. Bottles API (`src/api/bottles.ts`)
- Fetches bottles from Supabase
- Handles errors gracefully
- Returns typed data using the `Bottle` type from database types

### 2. BottleListItem Component (`src/components/BottleListItem.tsx`)
- Displays individual bottle information
- Shows brand, expression, type, proof, ABV, and age
- Uses emoji icons based on bottle type (🥃 for whiskey, 🍹 for rum, 🌵 for tequila/mezcal, 🍾 for others)
- Handles missing images with placeholder icons

### 3. Updated BottlesScreen (`src/screens/BottlesScreen.tsx`)
- Full implementation matching the CigarsScreen functionality
- Uses React Query for data fetching with automatic refetch
- Shows loading, error, and empty states
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Floating action button that navigates to the Scanner (via Cigars tab)

## How to Use

1. **View Your Bottles Collection**
   - Navigate to the "Bottles" tab in the bottom navigation
   - Your bottles will be displayed in a scrollable list
   - Shows total count at the top

2. **Refresh the List**
   - Pull down on the list to refresh

3. **Add New Bottles**
   - Currently, you can:
     - Run the `sample_data.sql` script to add test bottles
     - Add bottles directly in Supabase Dashboard
     - Use the scanner button (navigates to Cigars > Scanner)

## Sample Data Added
The `sample_data.sql` script includes 10 bottles:
- Buffalo Trace Single Barrel (Bourbon)
- Macallan 12 Year (Scotch)
- Redbreast 15 Year (Irish)
- Blanton's Single Barrel (Bourbon)
- Lagavulin 16 Year (Scotch)
- Four Roses Small Batch (Bourbon)
- Jameson Black Barrel (Irish)
- Glenfiddich 18 Year (Scotch)
- Woodford Reserve Double Oaked (Bourbon)
- Don Julio 1942 (Tequila)

## Next Steps
To fully complete the bottles functionality, consider:
1. Creating a separate Bottles stack navigator with its own Scanner
2. Implementing a bottle detail screen
3. Adding manual "Add Bottle" form
4. Implementing barcode scanning specifically for bottles
